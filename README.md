When I wanted to start my project and start building, despite the limited time I had, I did not lose hope in God and started building my project. While working on the project, I encountered an internet famine, but I continued working even though I did not need the internet to build the project. But when I faced a problem, I used the internet to ask for help from my friends who had more experience in building projects. At the beginning, I had an idea for a great project. After reviewing the last lesson, I gradually got an idea and took the first step towards building a great project. One of the main reasons why I tried to finish my project well and efficiently is my strong passion for web designing and coding. And finally, many thanks to the respected professor Ehsanullah Ehrari, who works hard for the progress and learning of her students, and thanks to all the respected members of Code To Inspire, hoping for even greater success.

Sincerely, Asma "Akrami"
